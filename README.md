## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AliHamza-071/AI_ML_Engingeer.git
    cd AI_ML_Engingeer
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    - Each project may require specific libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, keras, torch, etc.).  
    - Please check the top of each script/notebook for specific requirements and install them using pip:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
      *If requirements.txt does not exist, you can manually install the needed packages.*

## Project Descriptions

- **Customer_Segmentation.py**  
  Implements customer segmentation using clustering algorithms to group customers based on behavior and features.

- **Fake_News_Detection.py**  
  Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify news as real or fake.

- **Financial Time-Series Anomaly Detection.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates anomaly detection techniques in financial time-series data, useful for fraud detection and market analysis.

- **Review_sentimental_Analysis.py**  
  Performs sentiment analysis on textual reviews, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral.

- **Setllite_imagry_analysis.ipynb**  
  Explores satellite imagery using computer vision and ML techniques for pattern recognition and analysis.

---

## Usage

- Open the desired script (.py) in your IDE or run via command line:
    ```bash
    python Customer_Segmentation.py
    ```
- For notebooks (.ipynb), open with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Setllite_imagry_analysis.ipynb
    ```

- Modify input paths, parameters, or configurations as needed for your data and use case.
