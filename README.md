## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AliHamza-071/AI_ML_Engingeer.git
    cd AI_ML_Engingeer
    ```

2. **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    - Each project may require specific libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, tensorflow, keras, torch, plotly, seaborn, etc.)
    - Check each script/notebook for import statements.
    - Install common dependencies with:
      ```bash
      pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn nltk tensorflow keras torch plotly seaborn notebook
      ```
    - For notebooks, ensure you have jupyter installed:
      ```bash
      pip install notebook
      ```

## Project Descriptions

- **Customer_Segmentation.py**  
  Segments customers using clustering algorithms (KMeans, Hierarchical, 3D visualization) on features like age, income, and spending score. Visualizes clusters and analyzes demographic distributions.

- **Fake_News_Detection.py**  
  Detects fake news using NLP preprocessing and multiple machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, LSTM). Includes sample predictions and in-depth model evaluation.

- **Financial Time-Series Anomaly Detection.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook for anomaly detection in financial time-series data using statistical and ML techniques. Useful for fraud/outlier detection in finance.

- **Multi-Label Emotion Recognition from Text.ipynb**  
  Notebook implementing multi-label emotion classification on text data, leveraging NLP and deep learning to recognize multiple emotions in a single sentence or document.

- **Review_sentimental_Analysis.py**  
  Sentiment analysis of textual reviews (IMDB dataset) with logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM. Text preprocessing, TF-IDF features, and model comparison included.

- **Setllite_imagry_analysis.ipynb**  
  Satellite imagery analysis using computer vision and machine learning. Demonstrates data loading, preprocessing, and pattern recognition from satellite images.

## Usage

- For Python scripts:
    ```bash
    python Customer_Segmentation.py
    python Fake_News_Detection.py
    python Review_sentimental_Analysis.py
    ```
    (Modify input data paths as needed.)

- For Jupyter notebooks:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Financial Time-Series Anomaly Detection.ipynb"
    jupyter notebook "Multi-Label Emotion Recognition from Text.ipynb"
    jupyter notebook Setllite_imagry_analysis.ipynb
    ```

- Some scripts require downloading NLTK datasets or having data files (e.g., IMDB, Mall_Customers.csv, Fake/Real.csv) in the working directory.
