## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AliHamza-071/AI_ML_Engingeer.git
    cd AI_ML_Engingeer
    ```

2. **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    - Each project may require specific libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, tensorflow, keras, etc.)
    - Check each script/notebook for import statements.
    - You can install common dependencies with:
      ```bash
      pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn nltk tensorflow keras plotly seaborn
      ```
    - For notebooks, ensure you have jupyter installed:
      ```bash
      pip install notebook
      ```

## Project Descriptions

- **Customer_Segmentation.py**  
  Applies clustering algorithms (KMeans, Hierarchical) to segment customers using features like age, income, and spending score. Visualizes clusters using 2D and 3D plots and analyzes demographic distributions.

- **Fake_News_Detection.py**  
  Implements fake news detection using NLP techniques and machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and LSTM neural network). Includes text preprocessing, training, evaluation, and sample predictions.

- **Financial Time-Series Anomaly Detection.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter notebook demonstrating anomaly detection techniques on financial time-series data. Useful for detecting outliers or fraudulent activity in financial datasets.

- **Review_sentimental_Analysis.py**  
  Performs sentiment analysis on IMDB review data using text preprocessing and multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM). Compares model performances and allows testing on sample reviews.

- **Setllite_imagry_analysis.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter notebook for satellite imagery analysis. Applies image processing and machine learning/CV techniques to extract insights from satellite data.

## Usage

- For Python scripts:
    ```bash
    python Customer_Segmentation.py
    python Fake_News_Detection.py
    python Review_sentimental_Analysis.py
    ```
    (Modify input data paths as needed.)

- For Jupyter notebooks:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Financial\ Time-Series\ Anomaly\ Detection.ipynb
    jupyter notebook Setllite_imagry_analysis.ipynb
    ```

- Some scripts require downloading NLTK datasets or having data files (e.g., IMDB, Mall_Customers.csv, Fake/Real.csv) in the working directory.
